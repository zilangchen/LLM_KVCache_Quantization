# Iteration Log (Single Source of Progress)

This file is the only progress tracker for the repository.
`lang.md` is deprecated and archived.

## Current Status

- Active objective source: `objective.md`
- Active execution policy: `AGENTS.md`
- Active experiment protocol: `docs/final_experiment_protocol.md`
- Progress log source of truth: `iteration.md`

## Update Rules

1. After each completed functional unit, append one new entry under `Timeline` (latest first).
2. Every entry must include goal, changed files, commands run, outputs, and result quality.
3. If blocked, write explicit blocker and next action.
4. Keep entries concise and auditable; avoid vague summaries.

## Timeline (Latest First)

### 2026-02-22 10:49 | Workflow Guide Path Fixes
- Goal: prevent broken workflow guidance where agents/users follow a documented path but cannot find files or scripts.
- Scope: align active docs to one remote repo path and remove invalid script reference from skills.
- Changed files:
  - `README.md`
  - `docs/final_experiment_protocol.md`
  - `docs/final_results_summary.md`
  - `docs/thesis_preflight_checklist.md`
  - `.agent/skills/reproducibility/SKILL.md`
  - `.agent/skills/long-running-task/SKILL.md`
  - `iteration.md`
- Commands:
  - replace `/root/autodl-tmp/LLM_KVCache_Quantization` -> `/root/LLM_KVCache_Quantization` in active docs
  - replace invalid `scripts.utils` validation command with `scripts/run_experiments.py --config configs/exp_matrix.yaml --dry_run`
  - `rg -n` scans for deprecated paths and missing workflow references
- Outputs:
  - active workflow docs now point to existing canonical paths
  - reproducibility skill no longer references missing `scripts/utils.py`
- Validation:
  - no hits in active files for `.agents/`, `lang.md`, `docs/AGENT_README.md`, `scripts/agent_tools`, or `scripts.utils`
- Risks / follow-ups:
  - `development_record.md` keeps historical legacy references by design (not an active workflow guide)

### 2026-02-22 10:46 | Skill Directory Unification
- Goal: unify skill directories to a single canonical path and verify no active duplicate references remain.
- Scope: migrate `.agents/skills/*` into `.agent/skills/*`; remove `.agents`; run redundancy scan on active files.
- Changed files:
  - `iteration.md`
  - `.agent/skills/debug-iterate/SKILL.md` (moved)
  - `.agent/skills/execplan/SKILL.md` (moved)
  - `.agent/skills/repo-hygiene/SKILL.md` (moved)
  - `.agent/skills/unit-commit/SKILL.md` (moved)
- Commands:
  - `mv .agents/skills/{debug-iterate,execplan,repo-hygiene,unit-commit} .agent/skills/`
  - `rmdir .agents/skills && rmdir .agents`
  - `rg -n "\\.agents/" ...` and policy-keyword scans on active files
- Outputs:
  - single skill root: `.agent/skills/`
  - no active `.agents/` path references
- Validation:
  - `.agent/skills/` contains 7 skills; `.agents/` no longer exists
- Risks / follow-ups:
  - `development_record.md` is still historical and contains old path references by design

### 2026-02-22 10:00 | Agent Pipeline Consolidation
- Goal: unify agent execution pipeline and remove duplicated process management.
- Scope: replace `lang.md` with `iteration.md`; deprecate local task lock system; keep one policy path.
- Changed files:
  - `AGENTS.md`
  - `README.md`
  - `objective.md`
  - `iteration.md`
  - `.agent/skills/long-running-task/SKILL.md`
- Commands:
  - `rg -n "lang\\.md|AGENT_README\\.md|agent_tools/agent_cli" ...`
  - file migration and archive operations (see `development_history/archive_20260222_agent_pipeline_cleanup/MANIFEST.md`)
- Outputs:
  - unified policy references
  - archive manifest for deprecated workflow assets
- Validation:
  - active files no longer depend on `lang.md` or local lock CLI
- Risks / follow-ups:
  - historical docs still contain old references inside archive directories (expected)

## Legacy System Issues (Migrated)

| ID | Discovered | Issue | Trigger | Proposed Fix | Status |
|----|------------|-------|---------|--------------|--------|
| 001 | 2026-01-22 | Remote env package versions drift | Running `smoke_test.py` | Pin dependency versions and add startup checks | Tracked |
| 002 | 2026-01-22 | Doc/script/matrix drift causes reproducibility confusion | Aligning `development_record.md` with code and matrix | Enforce single entrypoint and config snapshots | Tracked |
| 003 | 2026-02-08 | Full-concat PPL tokenization creates long warnings and possible memory waste | Running `scripts/eval_ppl.py` | Use chunk/stream tokenization and record `max_length/stride` | Resolved |
| 004 | 2026-02-08 | Long remote runs break with direct SSH sessions | Remote `eval_ppl.py` validation | Use tmux background sessions and persisted logs | Tracked |
